# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

An array's index is the position of the element within the array. The value is element that the index is containing or representing.  

Researched answer:
The index is the storage location of the element in the array. The value "describes" the content of the element the index is storing.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:
They are the same because they are both indexed based, they both hold a length property, they can both share some of the methods and they both can be iterated. The are different because they are different data types, therefore they have access to those methods that are included in their specific data type and only their data type.

Researched answer:
They both can hold data, but the array can hold more than one value.
