# ASSESSMENT 1: Career Readiness

The LEARN program focuses on readying our students for a career in technology. The job hunt is a daunting process that requires a lot of preparedness. Complete the following tasks to ensure progress in your professional development.

LinkedIn is the world's largest online professional networking community. An active presence on LinkedIn allows you to make professional connections, look for employment opportunities, connect with others who share your interests, and learn more about the tech industry.

- Submit your "about me" statement:
My technology journey started during the whole COVID situation. Like many people, I was laid off during this time, but instead of taking this as a negative situation, I went the other way with it. I completed my bachelor's degree and then I started dabbling in web development. That dabbling turned into fun and that fun has now turned into a positive addiction.

- Submit the link to your LinkedIn profile with a custom shortened url:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-mckee-dev/

- [X] professional profile picture (must be your actual face)
